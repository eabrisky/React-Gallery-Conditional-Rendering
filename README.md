# React Gallery

## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

I've compiled an app that users can visit to gain a little glimpse into some of the memories I've captured in my life. Photos I've taken over the course of the past two years have been uploaded here for others to view. And if you've ever wanted to learn a little more about those moments, I've included descriptions for each photo that can be accessed by clicking on the photo. Users can also choose to like the photo, and view a count of how many times each photo has been liked in total.

### Installation

1. Create a database named `weekend-react-gallery`

2. The file `database.sql`, which is included in this repo, has all of the SQL queries required to set up the table and data and make the app ready to view on the DOM.

3. In your terminal, start postgres by typing `brew services start postgres`

4. Also in your terminal, start the server and the client by typing `npm run server` and `npm run client`. This may require more than one terminal window to achieve.

5. This should automatically open a new browser tab that will display the app.
